# London Housing Prices

For this project, London house pricing data was taken and analysed. The Knearest neighbours algorithm was used from the package `sklearn` in python as a machine learning tool. The first step is to scale the data so that it can be optimal for use within the algorithm. The predictor variables `east``north` and `fl_area` go through a calibrated scaler to transform them to z-scores. The tuning parameters of nearest neighbours=6, weights='uniform' and Euclidean distance metric p=2 were chosen. 
Then we initiate the response variable to be `price` and fit the regression of our 3 predictors to the scaled response variables. To optimise the turing parameters a scoring method is imported.

A grid search model is imported and we initiate the `estimator` to the nearest neighbour algorithm, scoring system is `mae` and the `param_grid` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to parameters. 

Each combination of items in the dictionary will be tested, and combination with the best `mae` will be selected. The selected values will be saved on the `opt_nn` which can be though of as a regression object that has fit and predict methods.

A pipeline algorithm is then implemented because of its convenience to calibrating models and making predictions using the original data, rather than manually re-scaling the data set every time. A grid search algorithm is then implemented in a similar way to the `opt_nn` which also fits our predictors and the response variable. 

To now visualise the outcome, a grid is created. This grid is bounded in a space defined by the spatial range of values of `Ã¨ast` and `north`. This grid array is assigned the value of average floor size of 92.88 sq meters. The grid can now be used for predict method and the response variable `price` is also made into a grid to be used in the method. The `hp_pred` dataset is now re-shaped to have the same dimensions and is ready for graphing.
